The UCI-like commands that I plan to support initially. All commands should be followed with a 
newline character only - there should be no other leading or trailing white space.

*** UI to engine ***

- newgame
    This indicates that the next position will be from a different game, so any existing caches
    should be cleared.

- position [khet string | standard | imhotep | dynasty] moves ...
    Setup a position defined by a starting position followed by a sequence of moves.

- go
    Start calculating on the specified position. There are a few parameters, one of which will be 
    specified with this command:
    - depth X
        Search to the specified depth.
    - movetime X
        Search for exactly X milliseconds.
    - infinite
        Search until a "stop" command is received.

- stop
    Stop calculating as soon as possible.

- quit
    Quit the program as soon as possible.

*** Engine to UI ***

- id
    Gets the name of the engine.

- bestmove X
    The engine has finished searching and returns the best move. If no moves were available (i.e.
    the game is already finished) then "bestmove none" will be returned.

- info
    The engine wants to send info to the UI. There are a few possible info-types:
    - depth X
        Search depth in plies.
    - time X
        The time that has been spent searching in milliseconds.
    - score X
        The score of the position that is being searched.
    - mate X
        A checkmate has been detected. X is the number of moves until mate (negative if the current
        player is going to be mated).
    - string X
        A string that the engine wants to display. Could contain debug info.
