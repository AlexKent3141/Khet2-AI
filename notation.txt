* Board representation for printing/reading from console. *

Due to the fact that pieces can be rotated it is difficult to represent them nicely in a single character. I am going to use two characters per piece.

The Pyramid has four distinct orientations. I define P1 to be the pyramid where the mirror is pointing to the North-East. Rotating anti-clockwise 90 degress from here generates P2, P3 and P4.

A similar definition is made for the Anubis: A1 = Anubis pointing North and generate A2, A3 and A4 by rotating anti-clockwise.

The Scarab only really has two orientations: S1 & S2. In S1 the mirrors point NE and SW, and in S2 the mirrors point SE and NW.

Each Sphinx can only rotate between two states, but between them all orientations are covered so define X1, X2, X3 and X4.

Rotating the Pharaoh is forbidden as it does not change the board state. This is represented by K0.

When printing the board it is probably nicest to have two copies of the board, one which just shows the piece types and another showing the rotations.

Silver goes first and their characters will be represented by uppercase characters. Red's pieces will be lower case. The board is shown from silver's perspective.

Using these conventions the "standard" initial board state is:

------------
|x...akap..|
|..p.......|
|...P......|
|p.P.ss.p.P|
|p.P.SS.p.P|
|......p...|
|.......P..|
|..PAKA...X|
------------

------------
|3000303200|
|0030000000|
|0004000000|
|1030120204|
|2040210103|
|0000002000|
|0000000100|
|0004101001|
------------

* Move representation *
There is no standardised notation for Khet moves so I introduce one for this program.

Similar to in chess, the columns are labelled by letters: a-j and the rows by numbers: 1-8.

For a rotation move the direction of the rotation must be specified, for this use +/- after the location where '+' indicates an anti-clockwise rotation and '-' a clockwise rotation.

Thus rotating the silver pyramid on h2 clockwise is denoted by "h2-".

For a non-rotating move we just specify the start and end locations algebraically.

Thus moving the silver pyramid on h2 left is denoted by "h2g2".
