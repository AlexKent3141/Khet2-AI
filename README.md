# Khet2-AI
AI program which plays Khet 2.0.

Khet 2.0 is an interesting two-player board game where each player must position their pieces (some of which have mirrored sides) so that when they fire their laser the opponent's Pharaoh is hit.

At the time of writing there isn't much established theory for Khet 2.0 so this work will be fairly experimental.
